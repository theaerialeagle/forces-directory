	The weak force, or weak interactions, are caused by W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup>, and Z<sup>0</sup> bosons. Bosons are exchange particles that interact with all elementary particles in the Standard Model, and are of two types. Those types are charge-changing (CC) and neutral.
	<br />
	<br />
	The charge-changing interactions involve W<sup>+</sup> and W<sup>-</sup> bosons, while the neutral weak force involves Z<sup>0</sup> bosons. CC weak interactions only occur between left particles or right antiparticles, while neutral interactions happen between both left and right particles.
