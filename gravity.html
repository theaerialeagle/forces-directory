	Gravity is an attractive force that is governed by the hypothetical graviton. Gravitons, unlike other exchange particles such as W and Z bosons and photons, have yet to be  observed; gravity is such a weak force that it makes detection of its exchange particles difficult. However, it has been speculated that the graviton would be a massless particle that travels at the speed of light, similar to photons.
