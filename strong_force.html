	The strong force is governed by the exchange of gluons of spin-1. Strong interactions are responsible for the structure of the atom and counteract the intense repelling force that would otherwise cause protons to fly away from each other. The protons and neutrons in the atom consist of quarks, which are held together by the color charge.
	<br />
	<br />There are 8 different types of gluons, each of which carries a color and an anti-color. When a gluon interacts with a quark, it changes the quark's color.
